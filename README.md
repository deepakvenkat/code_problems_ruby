Common code problems
==================
Inspired by [this](https://github.com/blakeembrey/code-problems)

All the problems are solved in ruby and tested out in rspec.

All the solutions are preseent in `lib\file_name.rb` and the tests for those are present in `spec\file_name_spec.rb`

>###To run the tests
>1. Clone the repo and then run `bundle install` to
install rspec.
>2. Then run `rspec spec/` to run the entire test suite.
>3. To run all tests in a specific file run `rspec spec/file_name.rb`
>4. To run a specific test in file run `rspec spec\file_name.rb:<line_number>`
